			<h3>Basic's of roulette</h3>
			<p>Roulette is a complete game of chance where players will try to guess which number the ball is going to land in next, players achieve this by placing bets out onto a layout on the table that is next to the roulette wheel.</p>
			<p>Each player is given a stack of colour chips in exchange for currency, each player is given a different colour so it is easy to distinguish whose bets are whose.</p>
			<p>You can Place bets in a number of different ways using your individual coloured chips, you can bet on one number straight up or you can place it between two numbers on the layout next to eachother this is known as a split, you can place it on the corner of a number so that chip is covering four numbers this is known as a corner, you also have the option of covering just three or six numbers with a single chip. now the more numbers you cover with just one chip the lower the payout is if that chip is covering a winning number higher chances equals lower payouts.</p>
			<p>A popular way for people to bet who are new to the game are the even chance bets such as black or red, even or odd and high or low numbers, these have even chances of coming in so pay even money.</p>

			<h3>Basics Of BlackJack!</h3>
			<p>Blackjack Is a Game where the player has to get closer to a total of 21 than the dealer</p>
			<p>To do this the player has the option to keep drawing cards and when they are happy with the total value they can choose to stick, then the dealer will continue to draw cards to determine his final result, if the player is closer to 21 than the dealer the player wins if not the player loses</p>
			<p>There are rules that the dealer must adhere to when drawing cards, if the dealer's total is 16 or less the dealer must take another card which could take him over the total of 21 causing him to bust and all players win, if the dealers result is 17 or higher but not above 21 the dealer must stand on his current total so all players with a score closer to 21 but not over 21 than the dealer win</p>
